The increasing reliance on digital devices has led to concerns about productivity, digital wellness, and screen time management. This project introduces Smart Screen Time Tracker, an AI-powered tool designed to monitor, analyse, and provide actionable insights into users' screen time habits. Leveraging libraries such as psutil, pandas, matplotlib, and plyer, the application tracks active applications, categorizes usage patterns, and generates personalized recommendations to optimize productivity and reduce excessive entertainment consumption. By integrating real-time notifications, advanced analytics, and gamified insights, this tool empowers users to make informed decisions about their digital habits.
